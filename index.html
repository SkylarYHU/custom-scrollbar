      <h2 class="card-title">The Majestic Lion</h2>
      <p>The lion is often referred to as the king of the jungle due to its strength, dominance, and regal appearance. Found primarily in Africa, lions live in groups called prides. Males are known for their large, flowing manes, which are not only a symbol of power but also help protect them during fights. Lions are apex predators, playing a crucial role in maintaining the balance of their ecosystem.</p>

      <h2 class="card-title">Elephants: Giants of the Land</h2>
      <p>Elephants are the largest land animals on Earth, with males sometimes weighing up to 12,000 pounds. These intelligent creatures are known for their close-knit family structures and extraordinary memory. Elephants use their long trunks for a variety of purposes, including breathing, grasping objects, and communicating. Sadly, they are often targeted by poachers for their tusks, which has led to a significant decline in their population.</p>

      <h2 class="card-title">Graceful Dolphins</h2>
      <p>Dolphins are social and highly intelligent marine mammals that live in oceans around the world. They are known for their playful behavior, frequently seen riding waves and leaping out of the water. Dolphins use a sophisticated form of communication that includes clicks, whistles, and body language. They are also known for their close bonds within pods, and their ability to work together to catch prey. Some species of dolphins have been observed using tools, which is a rare trait in the animal kingdom.</p>

      <h2 class="card-title">Cheetahs: Speed Demons</h2>
      <p>The cheetah is the fastest land animal, capable of running at speeds up to 60 miles per hour. Unlike other big cats, cheetahs rely on speed rather than strength to catch their prey, typically hunting in short bursts of energy. Their slim bodies, long legs, and unique black "tear marks" under their eyes help them achieve these incredible speeds while also enhancing their focus and ability to see over long distances. Unfortunately, cheetahs are listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss and human-wildlife conflict.</p>

      <h2 class="card-title">Giant Pandas</h2>
      <p>Giant pandas are known for their distinctive black-and-white fur and their love of bamboo. Native to China, these gentle giants spend most of their time eating, consuming as much as 40 pounds of bamboo per day. Despite their large size, pandas are skilled climbers and swimmers. Due to habitat loss and low birth rates, pandas were once considered endangered, but thanks to dedicated conservation efforts, their population has begun to recover.</p>

      <h2 class="card-title">Mysterious Owls</h2>
      <p>Owls are nocturnal birds of prey, known for their silent flight and extraordinary night vision. They have forward-facing eyes, which give them binocular vision, and their ability to rotate their heads up to 270 degrees allows them to see in almost every direction. Owls hunt small mammals, insects, and other birds, using their sharp talons to snatch prey from the ground. Their eerie calls have made them symbols of mystery in many cultures.</p>

      <h2 class="card-title">Colorful Parrots</h2>
      <p>Parrots are brightly colored birds found in tropical and subtropical regions. Known for their intelligence, some species of parrots can mimic human speech with incredible accuracy. They are social birds, often forming strong bonds with their human companions. Parrots have curved beaks and zygodactyl feet, meaning two toes face forward and two backward, which helps them grip branches and objects. However, many species are threatened by habitat loss and the illegal pet trade.</p>

      <h2 class="card-title">Playful Otters</h2>
      <p>Otters are playful, semi-aquatic mammals that can be found in rivers, lakes, and coastal areas. They are known for their playful behavior, often seen sliding down muddy banks or playing with pebbles. Otters are also skilled hunters, using their agile bodies to chase fish and other prey in the water. They are one of the few non-human animals known to use tools, often using rocks to crack open shellfish. Despite their playful nature, otters play a vital role in keeping their ecosystems balanced by controlling prey populations.</p>
